## What this repository is about 

This repository contains all the projects that i completed in the course of a unit that focuses on writing well thought out code as well as creating tests that test atleast 90% of the entire code base. The focus was on using structures such as MV, MVC and MVP in order to create an application that used input and output API's as well as a sql relational database to store and cache certain aspects of the application.
